backend:
  type: gcs
  gcs:
    # Use different state bucket per environment
    bucket: 'gcp-tatusl-tf-state-<%= @env %>'
    # GCS backend does not allow to write full object key, instead it allows passing wanted prefix.
    # State file name seems always be "default.state"
    # Here we use full path of module dir for object key prefix
    # Cleaner solution would be to use for example regex for getting name of the module from full path
    # See: https://github.com/Yleisradio/yle_tf#backend for example of regex usage
    prefix: <%= @module_dir %>
